# SIR-model
This is my first public data science model for forecasting new confirmed covid-19 in Thailand.
<h3> This study was inspired by paper named A Time-dependent SIR model for COVID-19 with Undetectable Infected Persons </h3>
I choose this model because people in Thailand are vaccinated only 15.5% (10/08/2021).
I consider the vaccinated as Susceptible because the vaccine can't cover for infected. That's why we consider as only 3-state deterministic model (SIR model)
